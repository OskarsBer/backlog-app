A game backlog tracking app I made while practicing full-stack CRUD.

### How It's Made:

- The UI is built using the templating language EJS and HTML/CSS.
- The backend is built using Node.js/Express + MongoDB/Mongoose.
- Validation is implemented using client-side HTML5/JS, with additional validation using MongoDB schema.<br><br>  

  **Tech used:**  HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, EJS<br><br>

### What I learned

* Gained experience designing full-stack applications.
* Explored techniques used to perform CRUD operations.
* Learned about various validation methods.<br><br>

#### Future updates
* Adding separate lists for completed & dropped games (only the last few would be shown).<br><br>
* Adding a user account system with login authentification.<br><br>
